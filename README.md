ETL Runner using FS2 and Cats
==============================

 ETL (short for Extract(read) => Transform(process) => Load(write)) is commonly used to moving data 
 from one place to another one.
 
 I wanted to learn a bit more about [FS2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2) 
 and [cats-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect). Firstly it's just a learning project so treat it with caution.
 We used modified version of it in production but it's WIP.
